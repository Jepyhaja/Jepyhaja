## Web developer at [Trimedia Oy](https://trimedia.fi) since 2019
### What do I do?
My main focus is on Laravel and therefore on PHP, alongside those technologies I use what ever needed for the project.
Most used technologies so far have been Vue.js, MySQL, Redis, Tailwind.
Newcomer to my stack is Statamic which is flexible CMS built on top of laravel.
I have aquired quite a bit of experience integrating [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) websites with various platforms.

TLDR I work on:
- Various [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) projects at Trimedia
- JavaScript apps with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/)
- Highly Customized Laravel CMS implementations with [Statamic](https://www.statamic.com)
- Service Integrations
- [Mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) database design.
- My own [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) projects when ever I have time to spare
